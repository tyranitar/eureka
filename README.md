# Eureka

Eureka is an app that guides high school students on their journey towards their ideal careers. Currently, it's just a proof of concept, but the application features are shown below.

The Home Page suggests articles about different career paths that the student can take, and shows personalized recommendations based on what kind of careers the student has looked at in the past:

The student can use the Search Page to find other careers that they might be interested in. The Search Page allows the student to tune the various search criteria and preview each Career Info Page before they commit to jumping in:
